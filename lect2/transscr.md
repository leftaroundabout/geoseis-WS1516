Example long, thin rod: simple 1D waves.

  c = \sqrt{E/\rho}

In 3D:
- Volume changes
    - Bulk modulus
- Shape changes

- Lame's constant $\lambda$ and Poisson's ratio $\nu$ are also elastic moduli
- $\nu$: ratio of radial to axial deformation when a one-dimensional stress is applied:


Volumetric strain:
$$
  \theta = \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_1}
         + \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial x_2}
         + \frac{\partial u_3}{\partial x_3}
$$
